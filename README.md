Short description of the app: For our project weâ€™ve recreated the game Minesweeper. The main screen will give the user three buttons to click; (1) To play the game. (2) To go over the rules of the game. (3) To display the highscores. Players enter a three letter uppercase username, and may choose from three difficulties to play from; Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The goal of the game is to successfully clear the grid without revealing a mine. Each numbered square gives a hint as to how many squares, that are mines, neighbor it. Flags may also be used to mark potential mines or uncertain squares. There is no time limit. Only upon winning is the time elapsed saved and displayed in the high scores screen. Regardless of the game's outcome, the player can try again as many times as they want.

Known bugs: 
     When a successful game is completed, and the time elapsed is less than 100 seconds, then the highscore screen will incorrectly order the ranking of the player because of          their time, but will still rank within the difficulty they played in. For example, Rank 1 played a Beginner game with 110 second completion. Rank 2 played a Beginner game          with 50 seconds completion. Rank 3 played an Intermediate game with 150 seconds completion. Rank 2 player will still rank lower than Rank 1 because of their time being            lower than 100, but rank higher than Rank 3 because of their difficulty.

Log in info: Once the start button is clicked the user will be taken to the difficulties scene and will be required to enter a username. If the user wins the game, the username will be shown in the high scores screen.

Versions or other requirements: The app was built using Java 8.0 and Scene Builder 2.0. All files (except MPApp.java, winner.GIF, and userInfo.txt) should be placed inside the application package in Eclipse. MPApp.java will be placed in the model package. 
    "MPApp.java" will go in the model package.
    "userInfo.txt" and "winner.GIF" should be placed in the "MinesweeperProject" folder where "bin" and "src" are found.
