Name of your team: Minesweepers 

Team member names: Seth Zapata, Jhonathan Mejia, Paul Perryman, Karla De La Cruz

Short description of the app: For our project weâ€™ve recreated the game Minesweeper. The main screen will give the user 3 buttons to click, to play the game, to go over the rules of the game, and to look at the highscores. 

Known bugs: N/A

Log in info: Once the start button is clicked the user will be taken to the difficulties scene and will be required to enter a username. If the user wins the game the username will be shown in the highscores scene.

Versions or other requirements: The app was built using Java 8 and Scene Builder 2.0. All files (except MPApp.java, winner.GIF, and userInfo.txt) should be placed inside the application package in Eclipse.
    - "MPApp.java" will go in the model package.
    - "userInfo.txt" and "winner.GIF" should be placed in the "MinesweeperProject" folder where "bin" and "src" are found.
